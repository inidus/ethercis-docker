This is the first cut of a docker based Ethercis deployment. 

It consist of two Docker containers which would be built and run by docker compose. 

Database and Java server images are created based on Dockerfiles which sit under the dedicated directories (docker_ethercis_db and docker_ethercis_server)

This docker compose file has been developed and tested using the following configuration:

Host OS: Ubuntu 16.04
Docker version: 18.03.1-ce, build 9ee9f40
Docker Compose version: version 1.21.2, build a133471

Run

docker-compose up

to build and run Ethercis postgres and Java images.
